## IoT-Noise

A simple arduino device for noise level detection, sharing this data with a central server, so any device connected to the internet can access this files.

## Motivation

In modern society, noise pollution has become a very common problem, mainly in great urban areas, where cars, horns and loud music have created a bustling and stressful environment. 

Based on this need of maintain and collect a large data from some noisy places, this project propose a very simples and low cost device for collecting and measure SPL (sound pressure level - measure used to analyse noise polution) and send it to a central server.
